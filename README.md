# OtherSmallCities A11y resting repository

I needed a quick access repo from where I can easily access files to test with assistive technology.
This is the place.

A list of test files can be found at [a11y testing](https://othersmallcities.github.io/a11y-testing).

All of this is still very much work in progress.
