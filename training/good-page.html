		<h2>The Cat</h2>
		<p>
			Come, my fine cat, against my loving heart;<br>
			Sheathe your sharp claws, and settle.<br>
			And let my eyes into your pupils dart<br>
			Where agate sparks with metal.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now while my fingertips caress at leisure<br>
			Your head and wiry curves,<br>
			And that my hand's elated with the pleasure<br>
			Of your electric nerves,<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I think about my woman â€” how her glances<br>
			Like yours, dear beast, deep-down<br>
			And cold, can cut and wound one as with lances;<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, too, she has that vagrant<br>
			And subtle air of danger that makes fragrant<br>
			Her body, lithe and brown.<br>
		</p>
