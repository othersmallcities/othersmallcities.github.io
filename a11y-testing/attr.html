		<h1>Attribute Test</h1>
		<main>
			<h2>Test setup</h2>
			<p>This test can be used to check how well certain attributes are machine translated and then read out by screen readers or ignored. The results should be self-explanatory.</p>
			<p>Text in italics are the text subjects.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The next sentence is a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with the <code>aria-label</code> "Label, Good day." and the a text node of "Good night". <span aria-label="Label, Good day."><em>Good night.</em></span></p>
			<p>The next sentence is a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with the <code>aria-description</code> "Description: This is a description." and the a text node of "This is is text". <span aria-description="Description: This is a description."><em>This is Text.</em></span></p>
			<hr>
			<p>The next sentence is a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with <code>aria-labelledby</code> linking to the next sentence and the a text node of Good night. <span aria-labelledby="day"><em>Good night.</em></span> <span id="day">Labelby: Good day.</span></p>
			<p>The next sentence is a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with <code>aria-describedby</code> linking to the next sentence and the a text node of "This is text". <span aria-describedby="text"><em>This is text.</em></span> <span id="text">Describedby: This is a description.</span></p>
			<hr>
			
			<p>Next will be a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> with the text "Button" and a useless but often used <code>title</code>-attribute of "Button description".</p>
			<button title="Button description">
				Button
			</button>
			<hr>
			<p>Lastly an image with the <code>alt</code>-text of "A man holding and looking intently at a small kitten. The kitten looks bored into the camera." The <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/man-kitten-pet-owner-kitty-tabby-1868563/">photo is from pixelbay</a>.</p>
